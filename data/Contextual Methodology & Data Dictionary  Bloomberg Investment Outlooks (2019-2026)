# Contextual Methodology & Data Dictionary: Bloomberg Investment Outlooks (2019-2026)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides the methodological context for the dataset `Bloomberg_Outlooks_2019_2026_Desagregado1.xlsx`. This dataset is a longitudinal aggregation of Bloomberg's annual "Investment Outlooks" series, capturing the consensus and contrarian views of over 50 major financial institutions across eight years.

The dataset is not a simple collection of random quotes; it is a structured representation of Bloomberg's **editorial curation process**. It reflects how the financial narrative has evolved from "Quantitative Tightening" in 2019 to "AI & Tariffs" in 2026, preserving the specific ranking and taxonomic logic applied by Bloomberg's editors at the time of publication.

## 2. Construction Logic & Methodology

### 2.1. The "Living" Taxonomy
Unlike rigid academic datasets, this database employs a **dynamic taxonomy** that shifts annually to reflect the market zeitgeist.
*   **Core Continuity:** The `BASE CASE` theme exists in every year, serving as the anchor for the dataset. It represents the primary macro-economic forecast for that year.
*   **Thematic Emergence:** New themes appear only when they become market-moving forces.
    *   *2019:* Focused on "Trade" and "Quantitative Tightening".
    *   *2021:* Introduced "COVID", "ESG", and "Rotation".
    *   *2024:* Shifted to "AI", "Magnificent 7", and "Soft Landing".
    *   *2026:* Centers on "Tariffs", "Fiscal Policy", and "AI Boom".
*   **Implication:** Blank fields in `Sub_theme` or `Section_description` for earlier years are not errors; they indicate that Bloomberg's editorial format was less granular in those years. The dataset faithfully records *only* what was explicitly categorized at the time.

### 2.2. The Ranking System (Conviction Metric)
The `Rank` column is the most critical metadata field.
*   **Not Alphabetical:** Institutions are **never** listed alphabetically.
*   **Editorial Conviction:** The order represents Bloomberg's assessment of the "narrative fit" or "conviction" of the call.
    *   **Rank 1-5:** The "Consensus Champions." These calls best articulate the dominant theme of the section (e.g., Citi's 2026 growth forecast aligning perfectly with the "Capex + Policy = Growth" narrative).
    *   **Lower Ranks:** Variations, nuanced hedges, or less detailed views.
*   **Replication Value:** To reproduce the "Bloomberg experience," one must respect this ordinal ranking. A randomized list would lose the narrative arc constructed by the editors.

## 3. Data Dictionary

| Field Name | Data Type | Definition & Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **id** | String | Unique identifier for each record, composed of `THEME-INSTITUTION-RANK-YEAR`. Ensures traceability. |
| **Theme** | String | The top-level category (e.g., `BASE CASE`, `EQUITIES`, `RISKS`). This is the primary filter for analysis. |
| **Sub_theme** | String | *Nullable.* The specific editorial headline for that section (e.g., "The Bull Market's Last Hurrah"). Provides narrative flavor. |
| **Section_description** | Text | *Nullable.* The introductory summary written by Bloomberg editors. This serves as the "Ground Truth" or consensus definition for that section. |
| **Rank** | Integer | The ordinal position (1 to N) of the call within its specific Year and Theme. Proxies for "Editorial Conviction." |
| **Institution** | String | The name of the financial entity (Bank, Asset Manager, Research House) issuing the call. |
| **Call_text** | Text | The verbatim excerpt of the investment outlook. This is the raw unstructured data. |
| **Year** | Integer | The outlook year (e.g., 2026 calls are published in late 2025). |

## 4. Structural Evolution (2019-2026)

The dataset reveals the evolution of Bloomberg's own reporting methodology:

*   **Phase 1 (2019-2022):** **Broad Categorization.** Themes were general (`GROWTH`, `INFLATION`, `POLITICS`). The `Sub_theme` and `Section_description` fields are often empty as the format was more list-based.
*   **Phase 2 (2023-2024):** **Granular Narratives.** Introduction of specific sub-narratives (`SOFT LANDING`, `MAGNIFICENT 7`). Metadata becomes richer.
*   **Phase 3 (2025-2026):** **Structured Synthesis.** The current format. Every section has a clear `Sub_theme` (e.g., "Capex + Policy = Growth") and a detailed `Section_description`. The taxonomy is highly formalized, separating "Macro" (Growth, Inflation) from "Asset Classes" (Stocks, Bonds).

## 5. Usage Guidelines for AI Agents

When utilizing this dataset for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or analysis:
1.  **Respect the Rank:** When summarizing a theme, prioritize calls with `Rank < 10` to capture the consensus view. Use lower-ranked calls to find contrarian outliers.
2.  **Filter by Year:** Always segment analysis by `Year`. A "Bullish" sentiment in 2019 (pre-COVID) has no relation to "Bullish" in 2021 (post-stimulus).
3.  **Handle Nulls Gracefully:** Expect `Sub_theme` to be missing for pre-2023 data. Use `Theme` as the reliable fallback for categorization.
